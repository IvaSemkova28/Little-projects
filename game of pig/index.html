                Player 1 rolls the dice. If the roll is anything other than 1, the number is added to the player's score.
                If the roll is a 1, it becomes Player 2's turn. Player 2 then rolls the dice, and the same rules apply.
                If you feel that your luck is running out, you can click the "Hold" button to add your current score to your final score.
                However, if you roll a 1 before holding, you lose all points that haven't been held. So, be careful and good luck!
                The winner is the first player to reach 100 points.
